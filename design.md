## Snooze timings
Generally offer:

* The next morning
* Later that same day (lunchtime, evening)
* This coming weekend
* Next week (next Mon 9am)
* Last (the most recent custom selection, assuming it was actually recent)

Don't offer times that are in the past

The next 9am, 1pm, or 6pm to happen (?)
The next 9am on Sat to happen
The next 9am on Monday to happen


There's no point snoozing for less than 5 minutes, so if the time is 
within 5 minutes of a boundary, consider it at or over the boundary.

If it's a monday morning, don't offer 'This Week' == monday at 9am
We already have 'tomorrow morning'. Offer 'Next week' == Monday +1

If it's a Fri Night / Sat morning, don't offer 'This Weekend' 
We already have 'tomorrow morning' for that. Offer 'Next Weekend' == Sat + 1
